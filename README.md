# Bellybutton_Biodiversity
## Purpose of Analysis
Javascript, HTML, and CSS were used to create a dynamic webpage to visualize bacterial data for each volunteer in the study.
Volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons and see a bar chart, bubble chart, guage chart, and customized demographic information.
